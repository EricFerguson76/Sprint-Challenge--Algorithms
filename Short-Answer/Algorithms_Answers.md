#### Please add your answers to the **_Analysis of Algorithms_** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)O(n) - loops through the list a constant amount of times

b)O(n log(n))- nested loops

c)O(n) - has a base case and uses recursion

## Exercise II

You need to find the lowest floor and the highest floor.

You need to find the midpoint and drop an egg.

If it breaks then you are too high. that is the current floor.

Find the midpoint of that floor and the lowest floor and drop an egg. If it breaks, then repeat the process.

Once the egg doesn't break then you have found the correct floor.
